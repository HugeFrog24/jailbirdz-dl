    "description": "The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite\nHTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube.\n\nSee the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-getting-started) for a few\nexamples of using the PeerTube API.\n\n# Authentication\n\nWhen you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility\nto generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one\naccess token can currently be used at a time__.\n\n## Roles\n\nAccounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on\nPeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#roles) for a detail of their permissions.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure\nof the API call, completed by a [RFC7807-compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) response body.\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 404 Not Found\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Video not found\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"title\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWe provide error `type` (following RFC7807) and `code` (internal PeerTube code) values for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/packages/models/src/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),\nbut it is still optional. Types are used to disambiguate errors that bear the same status code\nand are non-obvious:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Cannot get this video regarding follow constraints\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 403,\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\n  \"type\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#section/Errors/does_not_respect_follow_constraints\"\n}\n```\n\nHere a 403 error could otherwise mean that the video is private or blocklisted.\n\n### Validation errors\n\nEach parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator\nproceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from validation\nerrors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error description:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Incorrect request parameters: id\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"instance\": \"/api/v1/videos/9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\",\n  \"invalid-params\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"location\": \"params\",\n      \"msg\": \"Invalid value\",\n      \"param\": \"id\",\n      \"value\": \"9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"status\": 400,\n  \"title\": \"Bad Request\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.\n`invalid-params.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and\n`invalid-params.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `invalid-params.<field>.msg`\nis about.\n\n### Deprecated error fields\n\nSome fields could be included with previous versions. They are still included but their use is deprecated:\n- `error`: superseded by `detail`\n\n# Rate limits\n\nWe are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:\n\n| Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) | Calls         | Time frame   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| `/*`                         | 50            | 10 seconds   |\n| `POST /users/token`          | 15            | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/register`       | 2<sup>*</sup> | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` | 3      | 5 minutes    |\n\nDepending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service\nlimit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.\n\nYou can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the\nfollowing headers:\n\n| Header                  | Description                                                |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of remaining requests in the current time period    |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  |\n| `Retry-After`           | Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         |\n\n# CORS\n\nThis API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),\nallowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:\n\n| Endpoint                    |\n|------------------------- ---|\n| `/api/*`                    |\n| `/download/*`               |\n| `/lazy-static/*`            |\n| `/.well-known/webfinger`    |\n\nIn addition, all routes serving ActivityPub are CORS-enabled for all origins.\n"

Its protocol lets\nyou resume an upload operation after a network interruption or other transmission failure,\nsaving time and bandwidth in the event of network failures.\n\nFavor using resumable uploads in any of the following cases:\n- You are transferring large files\n- The likelihood of a network interruption is high\n- Uploads are originating from a device with a low-bandwidth or unstable Internet connection,\n  such as a mobile device\n\n### Import\n\n- _URL_-based: where the URL points to any service supported by [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/)\n- _magnet_-based: where the URI resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file\n- _torrent_-based: where the metainfo file resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file\n\nThe import function is practical when the desired video/audio is available online. It makes PeerTube\ndownload it for you, saving you as much bandwidth and avoiding any instability or limitation your network might have.\n"

décor : Aginter Presse est exposée comme une partie de ses archives alors que Guillou replonge dans l’ombre. Mais si on le croit en fuite et loin, il est en réalité encore au coeur du dispositif contre-révolutionnaire européen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ce cinquième épisode d’Agent Occident – Portrait d’un faf suit Guillou dans la phase terminale de la guerre froide clandestine. Du Portugal post-salazariste à l’Espagne de la transition, de l’Angola à l’Amérique latine, il réapparaît partout où la lutte anticommuniste se privatise, se criminalise et se radicalise. Terrorisme, mercenariat, coups d’État ratés, escadrons de la mort : les réseaux qu’il a fréquentés mutent et prolifèrent.<br />\nÀ mesure que la CIA est muselée par les scandales, d’autres structures émergent : clubs transnationaux, diplomatie parallèle, trafics, banques offshore. En Europe, la stratégie de la tension pourrit en Italie en Allemagne et en Belgique pendant qu’ailleurs, la même logique nourrit les dictatures sud-américaines, l’opération Condor et, finalement, la guerre clandestine afghane.<br />\nCet épisode raconte aussi la fin d’un cycle : celui d’une contre-révolution occidentale devenue opaque, corrompue et incontrôlable. Et pose une question centrale : contre le communisme, oui — mais pour quoi, exactement ?</p>\n<p>Agent Occident – Épisode 5 : 1974–1989</p>\n<p>Écrit, monté et raconté par Antoine SANCHEZ<br

Le nouveau rêve de la suprématie blanche ». Dans cet entretien il éclaire la généalogie intellectuelle de ce nouveau fascisme tech.</p>\n<p>👇 Abonne-toi pour ne rater aucune analyse sur les enjeux du présent technologique.</p>\n<p>🎙 Invité·e·s<br />\nNorman Ajari est philosophe et universitaire spécialisé dans les études décoloniales et la pensée noire. Il est l'auteur du \"Manifeste afro-décolonial: Le rêve oublié de la politique radicale noire\" (Éditions du Seuil, 2024) et de \"Noirceurs: Race, genre, classe et pessimisme dans la pensée africaine-américaine au XXIe siècle\" (Éditions Divergences, 2022). Son dernier essai, Technofascisme, Le nouveau visage de la suprématie blanche, paraît aux Éditions Météores le 20 février 2026.</p>\n<p>📌 Ce que tu vas apprendre</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Le concept de technofascisme : toutes les grandes entreprises fonctionnent comme des dictatures or l'État doit fonctionner comme une entreprise donc l'État doit fonctionner comme une dictature. Le syllogisme est au cœur du projet de la Silicon Valley autoritaire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Palantir et l'impérialisme réticulaire : pourquoi Alex Karp, PDG de Palantir, doit être pris au mot quand il dit que son entreprise est là pour \"tuer des ennemis\", de Gaza à l'Afrique, une mise à jour de l'impérialisme occidental par la technologie</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peter Thiel, prince du technofascisme : sa philosophie de l'histoire, son apologie du capitalisme de monopole et son projet de substituer la forme entreprise à la forme État</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>L'archéo-futurisme et la Nouvelle Droite française : le lien idéologique entre Guillaume Faye et les milliardaires techno-autoritaires d'aujourd'hui,  une généalogie intellectuelle française du technofascisme</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nick Land et ses cautions progressistes : comment ce philosophe pro-fasciste a pu longtemps se dissimuler derrière des compagnons de route féministes et afro-futuristes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technofascisme vs technoféodalisme : pourquoi les thèses de Varoufakis et Cédric Durand sont insuffisantes et en quoi la notion léniniste d'impérialisme éclaire mieux les dynamiques actuelles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Les racines européennes du technofascisme : le technofascisme n'est pas une rupture avec les Lumières mais leur radicalisation — l'Europe ne peut pas se poser en rempart face à un phénomène qu'elle a elle-même engendré</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sylvia Wynter et la tradition radicale noire : une alternative aux \"lumières blanches\" comme aux \"lumières obscures\" — penser l'humanité non comme un donné mais comme une praxis collective</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Que faire ?

Du Portugal post-salazariste à l’Espagne de la transition, de l’Angola à l’Amérique latine, il réapparaît partout où la lutte anticommuniste se privatise, se criminalise et se radicalise. Terrorisme, mercenariat, coups d’État ratés, escadrons de la mort : les réseaux qu’il a fréquentés mutent et prolifèrent.<br />\nÀ mesure que la CIA est muselée par les scandales, d’autres structures émergent : clubs transnationaux, diplomatie parallèle, trafics, banques offshore. En Europe, la stratégie de la tension pourrit en Italie en Allemagne et en Belgique pendant qu’ailleurs, la même logique nourrit les dictatures sud-américaines, l’opération Condor et, finalement, la guerre clandestine afghane.<br />\nCet épisode raconte aussi la fin d’un cycle : celui d’une contre-révolution occidentale devenue opaque, corrompue et incontrôlable. Et pose une question centrale : contre le communisme, oui — mais pour quoi, exactement ?</p>\n<p>Agent Occident – Épisode 5 : 1974–1989</p>\n<p>Écrit, monté et raconté par Antoine SANCHEZ<br

Le nouveau rêve de la suprématie blanche ». Dans cet entretien il éclaire la généalogie intellectuelle de ce nouveau fascisme tech.</p>\n<p>👇 Abonne-toi pour ne rater aucune analyse sur les enjeux du présent technologique.</p>\n<p>🎙 Invité·e·s<br />\nNorman Ajari est philosophe et universitaire spécialisé dans les études décoloniales et la pensée noire. Il est l'auteur du \"Manifeste afro-décolonial: Le rêve oublié de la politique radicale noire\" (Éditions du Seuil, 2024) et de \"Noirceurs: Race, genre, classe et pessimisme dans la pensée africaine-américaine au XXIe siècle\" (Éditions Divergences, 2022). Son dernier essai, Technofascisme, Le nouveau visage de la suprématie blanche, paraît aux Éditions Météores le 20 février 2026.</p>\n<p>📌 Ce que tu vas apprendre</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Le concept de technofascisme : toutes les grandes entreprises fonctionnent comme des dictatures or l'État doit fonctionner comme une entreprise donc l'État doit fonctionner comme une dictature. Le syllogisme est au cœur du projet de la Silicon Valley autoritaire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Palantir et l'impérialisme réticulaire : pourquoi Alex Karp, PDG de Palantir, doit être pris au mot quand il dit que son entreprise est là pour \"tuer des ennemis\", de Gaza à l'Afrique, une mise à jour de l'impérialisme occidental par la technologie</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peter Thiel, prince du technofascisme : sa philosophie de l'histoire, son apologie du capitalisme de monopole et son projet de substituer la forme entreprise à la forme État</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>L'archéo-futurisme et la Nouvelle Droite française : le lien idéologique entre Guillaume Faye et les milliardaires techno-autoritaires d'aujourd'hui,  une généalogie intellectuelle française du technofascisme</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nick Land et ses cautions progressistes : comment ce philosophe pro-fasciste a pu longtemps se dissimuler derrière des compagnons de route féministes et afro-futuristes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technofascisme vs technoféodalisme : pourquoi les thèses de Varoufakis et Cédric Durand sont insuffisantes et en quoi la notion léniniste d'impérialisme éclaire mieux les dynamiques actuelles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Les racines européennes du technofascisme : le technofascisme n'est pas une rupture avec les Lumières mais leur radicalisation — l'Europe ne peut pas se poser en rempart face à un phénomène qu'elle a elle-même engendré</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sylvia Wynter et la tradition radicale noire : une alternative aux \"lumières blanches\" comme aux \"lumières obscures\" — penser l'humanité non comme un donné mais comme une praxis collective</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Que faire ?

Du Portugal post-salazariste à l’Espagne de la transition, de l’Angola à l’Amérique latine, il réapparaît partout où la lutte anticommuniste se privatise, se criminalise et se radicalise. Terrorisme, mercenariat, coups d’État ratés, escadrons de la mort : les réseaux qu’il a fréquentés mutent et prolifèrent.<br />\nÀ mesure que la CIA est muselée par les scandales, d’autres structures émergent : clubs transnationaux, diplomatie parallèle, trafics, banques offshore. En Europe, la stratégie de la tension pourrit en Italie en Allemagne et en Belgique pendant qu’ailleurs, la même logique nourrit les dictatures sud-américaines, l’opération Condor et, finalement, la guerre clandestine afghane.<br />\nCet épisode raconte aussi la fin d’un cycle : celui d’une contre-révolution occidentale devenue opaque, corrompue et incontrôlable. Et pose une question centrale : contre le communisme, oui — mais pour quoi, exactement ?</p>\n<p>Agent Occident – Épisode 5 : 1974–1989</p>\n<p>Écrit, monté et raconté par Antoine SANCHEZ<br

Le nouveau rêve de la suprématie blanche ». Dans cet entretien il éclaire la généalogie intellectuelle de ce nouveau fascisme tech.</p>\n<p>👇 Abonne-toi pour ne rater aucune analyse sur les enjeux du présent technologique.</p>\n<p>🎙 Invité·e·s<br />\nNorman Ajari est philosophe et universitaire spécialisé dans les études décoloniales et la pensée noire. Il est l'auteur du \"Manifeste afro-décolonial: Le rêve oublié de la politique radicale noire\" (Éditions du Seuil, 2024) et de \"Noirceurs: Race, genre, classe et pessimisme dans la pensée africaine-américaine au XXIe siècle\" (Éditions Divergences, 2022). Son dernier essai, Technofascisme, Le nouveau visage de la suprématie blanche, paraît aux Éditions Météores le 20 février 2026.</p>\n<p>📌 Ce que tu vas apprendre</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Le concept de technofascisme : toutes les grandes entreprises fonctionnent comme des dictatures or l'État doit fonctionner comme une entreprise donc l'État doit fonctionner comme une dictature. Le syllogisme est au cœur du projet de la Silicon Valley autoritaire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Palantir et l'impérialisme réticulaire : pourquoi Alex Karp, PDG de Palantir, doit être pris au mot quand il dit que son entreprise est là pour \"tuer des ennemis\", de Gaza à l'Afrique, une mise à jour de l'impérialisme occidental par la technologie</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peter Thiel, prince du technofascisme : sa philosophie de l'histoire, son apologie du capitalisme de monopole et son projet de substituer la forme entreprise à la forme État</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>L'archéo-futurisme et la Nouvelle Droite française : le lien idéologique entre Guillaume Faye et les milliardaires techno-autoritaires d'aujourd'hui,  une généalogie intellectuelle française du technofascisme</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nick Land et ses cautions progressistes : comment ce philosophe pro-fasciste a pu longtemps se dissimuler derrière des compagnons de route féministes et afro-futuristes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technofascisme vs technoféodalisme : pourquoi les thèses de Varoufakis et Cédric Durand sont insuffisantes et en quoi la notion léniniste d'impérialisme éclaire mieux les dynamiques actuelles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Les racines européennes du technofascisme : le technofascisme n'est pas une rupture avec les Lumières mais leur radicalisation — l'Europe ne peut pas se poser en rempart face à un phénomène qu'elle a elle-même engendré</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sylvia Wynter et la tradition radicale noire : une alternative aux \"lumières blanches\" comme aux \"lumières obscures\" — penser l'humanité non comme un donné mais comme une praxis collective</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Que faire ?

Mais si on le croit en fuite et loin, il est en réalité encore au coeur du dispositif contre-révolutionnaire européen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ce cinquième épisode d’Agent Occident – Portrait d’un faf suit Guillou dans la phase terminale de la guerre froide clandestine. Du Portugal post-salazariste à l’Espagne de la transition, de l’Angola à l’Amérique latine, il réapparaît partout où la lutte anticommuniste se privatise, se criminalise et se radicalise. Terrorisme, mercenariat, coups d’État ratés, escadrons de la mort : les réseaux qu’il a fréquentés mutent et prolifèrent.<br />\nÀ mesure que la CIA est muselée par les scandales, d’autres structures émergent : clubs transnationaux, diplomatie parallèle, trafics, banques offshore. En Europe, la stratégie de la tension pourrit en Italie en Allemagne et en Belgique pendant qu’ailleurs, la même logique nourrit les dictatures sud-américaines, l’opération Condor et, finalement, la guerre clandestine afghane.<br />\nCet épisode raconte aussi la fin d’un cycle : celui d’une contre-révolution occidentale devenue opaque, corrompue et incontrôlable. Et pose une question centrale : contre le communisme, oui — mais pour quoi, exactement ?</p>\n<p>Agent Occident – Épisode 5 : 1974–1989</p>\n<p>Écrit, monté et raconté par Antoine SANCHEZ<br />\nProduit par Dancing Dog Productions<br />\nSon : Baptiste Veilhan, Théo Duchesne<br />\nGraphisme : Morgane Sabouret, Margaux Simon<br />\nProduction : Hicham Tragha<br />\nDirecteur du développement des collaborations extérieures : Mathias Enthoven<br />\nCo-directrice de la rédaction : Soumaya Benaïssa<br />\nDirecteur de la publication : Denis Robert</p>\n<p>Musique :</p>\n<p>PALAYAM (Antoine Sanchez)<br />\n<a href=\"http://palayam.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">palayam.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>EROS &amp; THANATOS -

Le nouveau rêve de la suprématie blanche ». Dans cet entretien il éclaire la généalogie intellectuelle de ce nouveau fascisme tech.</p>\n<p>👇 Abonne-toi pour ne rater aucune analyse sur les enjeux du présent technologique.</p>\n<p>🎙 Invité·e·s<br />\nNorman Ajari est philosophe et universitaire spécialisé dans les études décoloniales et la pensée noire. Il est l'auteur du \"Manifeste afro-décolonial: Le rêve oublié de la politique radicale noire\" (Éditions du Seuil, 2024) et de \"Noirceurs: Race, genre, classe et pessimisme dans la pensée africaine-américaine au XXIe siècle\" (Éditions Divergences, 2022). Son dernier essai, Technofascisme, Le nouveau visage de la suprématie blanche, paraît aux Éditions Météores le 20 février 2026.</p>\n<p>📌 Ce que tu vas apprendre</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Le concept de technofascisme : toutes les grandes entreprises fonctionnent comme des dictatures or l'État doit fonctionner comme une entreprise donc l'État doit fonctionner comme une dictature. Le syllogisme est au cœur du projet de la Silicon Valley autoritaire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Palantir et l'impérialisme réticulaire : pourquoi Alex Karp, PDG de Palantir, doit être pris au mot quand il dit que son entreprise est là pour \"tuer des ennemis\", de Gaza à l'Afrique, une mise à jour de l'impérialisme occidental par la technologie</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peter Thiel, prince du technofascisme : sa philosophie de l'histoire, son apologie du capitalisme de monopole et son projet de substituer la forme entreprise à la forme État</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>L'archéo-futurisme et la Nouvelle Droite française : le lien idéologique entre Guillaume Faye et les milliardaires techno-autoritaires d'aujourd'hui,  une généalogie intellectuelle française du technofascisme</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nick Land et ses cautions progressistes : comment ce philosophe pro-fasciste a pu longtemps se dissimuler derrière des compagnons de route féministes et afro-futuristes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technofascisme vs technoféodalisme : pourquoi les thèses de Varoufakis et Cédric Durand sont insuffisantes et en quoi la notion léniniste d'impérialisme éclaire mieux les dynamiques actuelles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Les racines européennes du technofascisme : le technofascisme n'est pas une rupture avec les Lumières mais leur radicalisation — l'Europe ne peut pas se poser en rempart face à un phénomène qu'elle a elle-même engendré</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sylvia Wynter et la tradition radicale noire : une alternative aux \"lumières blanches\" comme aux \"lumières obscures\" — penser l'humanité non comme un donné mais comme une praxis collective</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Que faire ? La voie léniniste : socialiser Palantir pour pouvoir le détruire, attaquer les entreprises de l'intérieur, redonner aux travailleurs le pouvoir dans les structures qui sont aujourd'hui les vrais lieux du gouvernement</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>📚 Pour aller plus loin<br />\nTechnofascisme.

Mais si on le croit en fuite et loin, il est en réalité encore au coeur du dispositif contre-révolutionnaire européen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ce cinquième épisode d’Agent Occident – Portrait d’un faf suit Guillou dans la phase terminale de la guerre froide clandestine. Du Portugal post-salazariste à l’Espagne de la transition, de l’Angola à l’Amérique latine, il réapparaît partout où la lutte anticommuniste se privatise, se criminalise et se radicalise. Terrorisme, mercenariat, coups d’État ratés, escadrons de la mort : les réseaux qu’il a fréquentés mutent et prolifèrent.<br />\nÀ mesure que la CIA est muselée par les scandales, d’autres structures émergent : clubs transnationaux, diplomatie parallèle, trafics, banques offshore. En Europe, la stratégie de la tension pourrit en Italie en Allemagne et en Belgique pendant qu’ailleurs, la même logique nourrit les dictatures sud-américaines, l’opération Condor et, finalement, la guerre clandestine afghane.<br />\nCet épisode raconte aussi la fin d’un cycle : celui d’une contre-révolution occidentale devenue opaque, corrompue et incontrôlable. Et pose une question centrale : contre le communisme, oui — mais pour quoi, exactement ?</p>\n<p>Agent Occident – Épisode 5 : 1974–1989</p>\n<p>Écrit, monté et raconté par Antoine SANCHEZ<br />\nProduit par Dancing Dog Productions<br />\nSon : Baptiste Veilhan, Théo Duchesne<br />\nGraphisme : Morgane Sabouret, Margaux Simon<br />\nProduction : Hicham Tragha<br />\nDirecteur du développement des collaborations extérieures : Mathias Enthoven<br />\nCo-directrice de la rédaction : Soumaya Benaïssa<br />\nDirecteur de la publication : Denis Robert</p>\n<p>Musique :</p>\n<p>PALAYAM (Antoine Sanchez)<br />\n<a href=\"http://palayam.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">palayam.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>EROS &amp; THANATOS - Catherine WATINE (album INTRICATION QUANTIQUES © 2020) <a href=\"http://www.watineprod.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.watineprod.com</a></p>\n<p>Bourbonese Qualk<br />\n<a href=\"http://bourbonesequalk.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bourbonesequalk.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>Y Create - Untitled - From the 3 - Cassette release The Black Box (1984)<br />\n<a href=\"http://hesselveldman.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hesselveldman.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>Nostalgie Eternelle - Devotion<br />\n<a href=\"http://nostalgieeternelle.jimdoweb.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nostalgieeternelle.jimdoweb.com</a></p>\n<p>BRUME (Christian Renou) - A Céline Part 1 &amp; 2 - Neue Muster Volume 10 (1993)<br />\n<a href=\"http://elsieandjack.com/brume\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elsieandjack.com/brume</a></p>\n<p>RON BERRY - Tomb of the Tortured Spirits - The Reaper (1988)<br />\n<a href=\"http://ron-berry.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ron-berry.co.uk</a></p>\n<p>Le site : <a href=\"https://www.blast-info.fr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.blast-info.fr/</a><br />\nFacebook : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blastofficiel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.facebook.com/blastofficiel</a><br />\nTwitter : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blast_france\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/blast_france</a><br />\nInstagram : <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blastofficiel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.instagram.com/blastofficiel/</a><br />\nMastodon : <a href=\"https://mamot.fr/web/@blast_info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://mamot.fr/web/@blast_info</a><br />\nPeertube : <a href=\"https://video.blast-info.fr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://video.blast-info.fr/</a><br />\nTwitch : <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/blastinfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.twitch.tv/blastinfo</a><br />\nBluesky : <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/blast-info.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bsky.app/profile/blast-info.fr</a></p>\n<p>#fascisme<br />\n#histoire<br />\n#propagande</p>\n",

Le nouveau rêve de la suprématie blanche ». Dans cet entretien il éclaire la généalogie intellectuelle de ce nouveau fascisme tech.</p>\n<p>👇 Abonne-toi pour ne rater aucune analyse sur les enjeux du présent technologique.</p>\n<p>🎙 Invité·e·s<br />\nNorman Ajari est philosophe et universitaire spécialisé dans les études décoloniales et la pensée noire. Il est l'auteur du \"Manifeste afro-décolonial: Le rêve oublié de la politique radicale noire\" (Éditions du Seuil, 2024) et de \"Noirceurs: Race, genre, classe et pessimisme dans la pensée africaine-américaine au XXIe siècle\" (Éditions Divergences, 2022). Son dernier essai, Technofascisme, Le nouveau visage de la suprématie blanche, paraît aux Éditions Météores le 20 février 2026.</p>\n<p>📌 Ce que tu vas apprendre</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Le concept de technofascisme : toutes les grandes entreprises fonctionnent comme des dictatures or l'État doit fonctionner comme une entreprise donc l'État doit fonctionner comme une dictature. Le syllogisme est au cœur du projet de la Silicon Valley autoritaire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Palantir et l'impérialisme réticulaire : pourquoi Alex Karp, PDG de Palantir, doit être pris au mot quand il dit que son entreprise est là pour \"tuer des ennemis\", de Gaza à l'Afrique, une mise à jour de l'impérialisme occidental par la technologie</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peter Thiel, prince du technofascisme : sa philosophie de l'histoire, son apologie du capitalisme de monopole et son projet de substituer la forme entreprise à la forme État</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>L'archéo-futurisme et la Nouvelle Droite française : le lien idéologique entre Guillaume Faye et les milliardaires techno-autoritaires d'aujourd'hui,  une généalogie intellectuelle française du technofascisme</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nick Land et ses cautions progressistes : comment ce philosophe pro-fasciste a pu longtemps se dissimuler derrière des compagnons de route féministes et afro-futuristes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technofascisme vs technoféodalisme : pourquoi les thèses de Varoufakis et Cédric Durand sont insuffisantes et en quoi la notion léniniste d'impérialisme éclaire mieux les dynamiques actuelles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Les racines européennes du technofascisme : le technofascisme n'est pas une rupture avec les Lumières mais leur radicalisation — l'Europe ne peut pas se poser en rempart face à un phénomène qu'elle a elle-même engendré</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sylvia Wynter et la tradition radicale noire : une alternative aux \"lumières blanches\" comme aux \"lumières obscures\" — penser l'humanité non comme un donné mais comme une praxis collective</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Que faire ? La voie léniniste : socialiser Palantir pour pouvoir le détruire, attaquer les entreprises de l'intérieur, redonner aux travailleurs le pouvoir dans les structures qui sont aujourd'hui les vrais lieux du gouvernement</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>📚 Pour aller plus loin<br />\nTechnofascisme. Le nouveau visage de la suprématie blanche — Norman Ajari — Éditions Météores, 2026</p>\n<p>✍🏻 Crédits<br />\nEntretien : Nastasia Hadjadji<br />\nMontage : Gerald Holubowicz</p>\n<p>👉 Si cette vidéo t'aide à voir l'envers de la tech, pense à t'abonner, liker et partager : ça soutient notre travail et rend ces enjeux plus visibles.</p>\n<p>💌 Inscris-toi à la newsletter sur <a href=\"https://synthmedia.fr/newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://synthmedia.fr/newsletter/</a><br />\n✊🏼 Et si tu le peux, soutiens Synth sur <a href=\"https://synthmedia.fr/soutenir/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://synthmedia.fr/soutenir/</a></p>\n<p>Notre site : <a href=\"https://synthmedia.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://synthmedia.fr</a><br />\nBluesky : <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/synthmedia.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bsky.app/profile/synthmedia.fr</a><br />\nInstagram : <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/synth.med.ia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.instagram.com/synth.med.ia/</a><br />\nMastodon : <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@synthmedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://mastodon.social/@synthmedia</a></p>\n",
